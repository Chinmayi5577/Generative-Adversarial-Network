# Generative-Adversarial-Network
Square_dataset : Create a dataset of 64x64 images, with black backgrounds and colored squares. The dataset should have squares of diï¬€erent colors, sizes, and orientations. Create a dataset of at least 1000 images. Train DC-GAN on the dataset of colored squares.
Panda : Create a dataset consisting of 64x64 images of a animal(here panda) and train a DC gan to create more panda faces.
